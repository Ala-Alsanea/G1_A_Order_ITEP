| QS1 | During busy lunch hours, the app handles a 3x spike in orders without slowing down, keeping response times fast.
| QS2 | When a customer places an order on the app, they should get order confirmation back within just 5 seconds, even during peak periods.
| QS3 | The platform can be easily scaled and adapted to support increased volume when launching in new regions.
| QS4 | When the team needs to quickly add a new feature, the modular design should allow them to integrate it efficiently, without disrupting ongoing development.
| QS5 | The team uses thorough testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to catch issues early and ensure correct functioning.
