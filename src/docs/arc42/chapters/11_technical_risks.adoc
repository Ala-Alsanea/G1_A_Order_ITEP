=== Technical Debts
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Risks | Description
|  Scalability | If the system is not designed with scalability in mind from the beginning, it could lead to significant rework as the user base grows.
|  Maintainability | If the codebase is not well-organized and documented, it could lead to increased time for bug fixing and adding new features.
|  Lack of Automated Testing | If the project does not have a good suite of automated tests, it could lead to more bugs in production and more time spent on manual testing.
